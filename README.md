### Predicting sunspot activity through radio wave fluctuations in the upper atmosphere

## Lambda School Unit 2 Project
As part of Lambda's School curriculum, we were tasked with selecting a data set to train a predictive model on and create a blog post detailing the steps we took and the results of our predictive analysis.  

Initially I found the sunspot dataset on Kaggle, and knew this would be a fun set to build a predictive model on, however given the limited features of the data, any predictive analysis would be limited to a time series prediction only. 

In order to dig a little deeper into the topic of sunspots, I also found a dataset that contained radiotelescope readings of our upper atmosphere.  WIth my background in radio communications, I was familiar with the intimate relationship that exists between solar activity and terrestrial radio waves.  

With my datasets in hand, I set out to complete this predictive analysis.  The full analysis report can be found [here](https://medium.com/swlh/sunspotting-a2a435526235).
